I'm a passionate computer scientist specializing in data science, particularly in Machine Learning. Currently, I'm serving as a staff computer scientist at Jefferson Lab (Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility) in Newport News, VA, USA. My primary focus lies in developing and implementing machine learning solutions for particle accelerators and Nuclear Physics (NP) experiments.

<div style="text-align: justify">
I've had the opportunity to collaborate with scientists from various institutions, including the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator in Oak Ridge, SLAC National Laboratory at Stanford University, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), and the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at Jefferson Lab. Together, we work on developing and deploying ML solutions tailored to the unique challenges of accelerators.

My work primarily revolves around ML-assisted data quality monitoring, anomaly prediction, and optimization. I'm particularly interested in exploring Reinforcement Learning and Continual Learning techniques to enhance the adaptability of deployed ML models. Lately, I've also delved into developing Graph Neural Network-based models for charged particle tracking in NP experiments and deploying them on edge hardware.
